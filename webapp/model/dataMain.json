The answer is this course is not where we are merely teaching you all technical jargons but a project is driven course.\nWhat we have done is broken down the entire topics which one has to know to become a NodeJS developer, who can work and create enterprise level App.\nThen we created an interesting project which is to create your own Instagram using NodeJS, so while learning you will be hooked to the course. Unlike other courses we have kept the quality high, learning deep and project interesting.\nYour instructor is not merely any normal developer but a CTO and Co-Founder and they have been in the situations where stakes were high, work was demanding and the competition was world class. They will not only share the know how but the essential experience which they gained. They have kept everything crystal clear and simple to understand.\nTechnical course description:\nYou'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node. We'll dive into websites, web apps and APIs with Express and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers. During it all, you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.\nNote: In this course, you'll also get access to private Facebook support by instructor where you can interact with them on one-on-one basis, access to git repository of all the (starter) code and after completing this course and exams you will get a certification of completion which you can post to your LinkedIn account as well.\nWhat are the requirements?\n✔Basic Javascript knowledge\n✔Basic HTML knowledge\n",

				"Desc": "Course description\nWith the advancement of technology, Internet of Things(IoT) is gaining a lot of popularity. Soon working on both hardware and software would be a major requirement. The complexity involved in working with hardware is a lot as it is very little to no scope of making errors here. In addition to that concept like Analog and Digital Signal Processing plays a very important role here. While building this IoT course, we have kept all these factors in mind and are ready to take you from a basic programmer to professional designer, who will be able to work on industry standards and build POC's for them too.\nThis course is designed to take you through this learning experience one step at a time and every part of the step is hands-on, from blinking of an LED to rotating stepper motor, from designing your own Arduino on a breadboard to designing an autonomous line follower bot. All the lessons are simple to follow and engaging at the same time.\nThis course is for \n✔Anyone with an interest in learning hardware aspect of IoT.\n✔Professionals working majorly on IoT projects.Engineering students.\n✔IoT hobbyists who want to learn more about Arduino and create their own use case.\n✔Anyone who wants to learn more about using Arduino.\nWhat will you learn:\n✔How does Arduino Uno work?\n✔Basic LED Blinking.\n✔How does an H-Bridge work?\n✔How does a DC Motor work?\n✔How does a Stepper Motor work?\n✔Methods to find the type of Stepper Motors.\n✔How does an LDR work.\n✔How does an IR Transmitter and IR Receiver work?\n✔How to connect a Motor to a Driver.\n✔How to Assemble and Program the Sensors.\n✔How to Code the Line Follower Robot.\nSummary:\nYou will first understand how to work with Arduino.\n✔Then we will move on to understand blinking LED's.\n✔Which takes us to the next step which is learning how Arduino works with Analog Sensors and we'll have practicals with stepper motors.\n✔And then learn how to create your own Arduino.\n✔Finally, you will understand how to make Line Follower autonomous bot using customized Arduino in breadboard.\n",

				"Desc": "Course description\nWhat is ESP8266 and why you should learn it\nESP8266 is among the most integrated Wi-Fi chips in the industry. Measuring just 5mm x 5mm, ESP8266 requires minimal external circuitry and integrates a 32-bit Tensilica microcontroller, standard digital peripheral interfaces, antenna switches, power amplifier, low noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management modules - all in one small package. Which makes it perfect for IoT use-case design and development. In many cases, even the production IoT landscape is using ESP8266 due to its capabilities and powerful features. On top of that, it is low cost and available readily.\nWhy you should consider taking this course?\nOne of the challenges while working with ESP8266 is its learning curve. Tools and techniques which one needs to master to get comfortable while using it in projects need to be understood well with a clear understanding of basics. Keeping that in mind we have designed the Professional ESP8266 development course. This course will cover all the concepts one needs to master starting from basics, you will learn how the Architecture of ESP8266 is designed, then you will understand how the flashing is done in ESP8266 where you load your OS, connecting ESP8266 to the internet is then the major step where you will understand the capability of a hardware to communicate with the internet which will enable the IoT . Most of the time hardware endpoints will be connected to data stream network cloud which can manage scale, security, and a stream of communication. We are using a widely used platform which is PubNub with ESP8266 to demonstrate this.\nAt the end, we will put everything together and also have a small end to end project of a smart home where we will cover from circuit design, development, and implementation with Go-Live.\nWhat are prerequisite\n✔A basic idea of computers and software parts are required\n✔Basic programming skills are required to understand programming syntaxes while coding with ESP8266 and flashing bin files.\n",
